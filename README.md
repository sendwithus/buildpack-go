This repo is used as a buildpack for sendwithus go projects on heroku. It expects all vendor dependencies to be included in a vendor folder with the src go files. It will not pull down any dependencies. It also requires the GO_INSTALL_PACKAGE_SPEC config var to be set in heroku-land before the application will compile correctly. This buildpack can either be set in the heroku cli or in the settings for the app on heroku
